## Purpose of Finding mu!

This application tries to find how to find mu of a child's height on galton's data.

By using the slider a user can simply find the lowest MSE value which finds the mu of the data in a given parameter.

We can confirm the result with the formula at the conclusion.

## What is mu

"??" is the lower case of greek letter mu.

It is a mean of a probability distribution in statistics.

Often used to describe the population mean!

## What is MSE

In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the "errors", 

that is, the difference between the estimator and what is estimated.(Wikipedia)

Therefore, smallest MSE given the mu should provide the most accurate mu.

## Conclusion

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(UsingR); data(galton)
round(mean(galton$child))
```

Mean calculated above should equal to graphically found mu.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
publish(user = "monggul", repo = "slidify")
```
